Make sure that you do not add the word file (githw.doc) into your git repository.
Git repositories are designed for text files like this README.txt file and like source code. 
MS Word files, pdf files, etc. display text but they are not text files, they are binary files 
(it is analogous to the way that a gif image of words displays text but is not a text file).
